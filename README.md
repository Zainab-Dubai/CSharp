# CSharp

## Overview
This repository contains my C# practice projects developed during my learning journey.  
Each project demonstrates key concepts of the C# language and the .NET framework, including:
- Object-Oriented Programming (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces)
- Operator overloading and method parameters
- ASP.NET MVC for web development
- Entity Framework for database integration

## Projects Included
- **Employee Class Exercises** → Operator overloading, interfaces, polymorphism  
- **Car Insurance Quote App** → ASP.NET MVC project with CRUD operations, form validation, and SQL Server integration  
- **Console Applications** → Hands-on drills with classes, methods, and interfaces
